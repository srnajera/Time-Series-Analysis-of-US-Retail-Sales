# Project Title: Time Series Analysis of US Retail Sales

## Project Overview
This project delves into the analysis of US retail sales data from January 1992 to June 2021, employing time series modeling techniques to forecast monthly sales. Through meticulous data handling and model implementation, the study provides insights into retail sales trends, seasonality, and predictive accuracy over the specified period.

## Data Preparation and Visualization
The initial phase involved loading the dataset and reshaping it for time series analysis. A visual representation of monthly retail sales over the years was plotted, revealing trends, seasonality, and potential cyclical changes in retail sales across the United States.

## Methodology
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, using the last year of data (July 2020 â€“ June 2021) as the test set to evaluate the model's predictive performance.
- **Modeling Approach:** A Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was configured and fitted to the training set. The SARIMA model, chosen for its ability to handle both seasonality and trends in time series data, was parameterized with specific values for its seasonal and non-seasonal components.
- **Prediction and Evaluation:** The model was then used to forecast retail sales for the test period, with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric employed to assess the accuracy of these predictions against actual sales data.

## Results
The project achieved a predictive model with an RMSE of 59800.722, indicating the model's performance in forecasting monthly retail sales. This outcome highlights the model's effectiveness in capturing the underlying patterns within the retail sales data, albeit with room for further optimization.

## Reflections and Ethical Considerations
In conducting this analysis, careful consideration was given to ethical implications, including the responsible use of data and the interpretation of model predictions. The project underscores the importance of transparent methodology and the critical evaluation of model outputs to avoid overreliance on predictive analytics without due consideration of potential inaccuracies or biases.

## Conclusion
This time series analysis of US retail sales underscores the value of SARIMA modeling in forecasting economic indicators. By providing a robust framework for understanding and predicting retail sales trends, this project contributes valuable insights that could aid retailers, policymakers, and economic analysts in decision-making processes.
